<h1 class="center underline bold">What Makes <span class="italic">Tax Matters </span>So Unique?</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
  Tax Matters is not a large franchise chain! Every return is personally prepared by myself, 
  John Daubman the owner of Tax Matters- a small, hometown accountant with 30 years of experience, 
  not some recently hired "trainee" Big is not better!  I serve a small client base that desires a long-term, 
  personal relationship with a skilled accountant they can trust to prepare their tax return. My clients are tired 
  of the impersonal treatment and overall lack of concern, knowledge, and experience of the so-called "Tax Pros" 
  out there. They appreciate what it means to have their own small town accountant going to bat for them! 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
  Tax Matters is owner operated, friendly and personable! I develop personal relationships with my clients. 
  Many go back more than 20 years and have become old friends! Our unconventional office provides a 
  relaxed, pleasant yet professional atmosphere to meet and discuss your own unique tax situation.

I am always available to clients! Even evenings and weekends, 365 days a year! Our office doesn’t 
close after April 15th and because my practice is attached to my home, I'm always here to answer 
any questions about your Tax Return or any other concerns you may have.  Sometimes it’s just a 
quick question, but it’s nice to be able to speak to me right away!
</p>

<p>
Quick drop off service! Allows you to leave your return without an appointment. 
Although a complete consultation with myself is always your option, many clients 
like to simply drop off their information at their convenience using my Lockbox Service.
