   <p>
   My name is John Daubman and I've been a Tax Accountant in Dutchess County for over 30 years.
    I formed Tax Matters in 1999 because I wanted to create a very unique type of Tax Preparation Firm. 
    I wanted to give my clients what I would like, good old-fashioned hometown personal attention combined with 
    quality work! I created Tax Matters to be like your hometown doctor, the corner butcher or the neighborhood 
    pharmacist of years gone by because like many, I detest the impersonal treatment of individuals by the 
    large companies we all must deal with <span> daily! </span>
   </p>
   <p>
	If you’re looking for a big, stuffy, Accounting Firm, with no time for the little guy, or a Name Brand Franchise 
	complete with all their incompetence & inexperienced “Trainees”, Tax Matters is not for you! 
	<p>
	<p class="center"><span class="big-bold">But</span></p>
	<p>If your like me and are sick & tired of the big, impersonal, uncaring & indifferent companies in today’s world, 
	then feel free to explore this site and to call me, personally! <span class="underline" >I promise you a refreshing change!</span>
	</p>

    <h1 class="center">What Makes <span class="italic">Tax Matters </span>So Unique?</h1>
   <ul>
    <li>
   <h7 class="bold-underline">Tax Matters is not a franchise chain!</h7>
    <p>
      Every return is personally prepared by myself, John A. Daubman the owner of Tax Matters LLC. A small, hometown
      accountant with 35 years of experience, not some recently hired "trainee" <span class="bold-underline">Big is not better!</span>
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
   <h7 class="bold-underline">Owner operated, freindly and personable!</h7>
    <p>
      I develop personal relationships with my clients. Many go back more than 20 years and have become old freinds!
      Our office provides a relaxed, pleasant yet professional atmosphere to meet and discuss your own Unique Tax Situation.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h7 class="bold-underline">I am always available to clients!</h7>
    <p>
      Even evenings and weekends, 365 days a year! Our office doesnt close after April 15th and because my practice
      is attached to my home, I'm always here to answer any questions about your Tax Return or any other concerns you may have
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h7 class="bold-underline">Free E-filing of your return with direct deposit of your refind to your account!</h7>
    <p>
      We don't have hidden fees or extra charges for e-tiling as some other perparers do.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h7 class="bold-underline">Quick drop off service!</h7>
    <p>
      Allows you to leave your return without an appointment. Although a complete consultation with myself is
      always your option, many clients like to simply drop off their information at their convenience using my
      Lockbox Service.
    </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   </br>
   </br>
   </br>
   <h1 class="center" >Concerned about my fees???</h1>
   <p>
      Some clients initially fear that a private accountant that provides all these services will be very expensive.
      <span class="bold">Well, most are but, Tax Matters isn't! Eacher year I check my fees against the
      national chains and consistantly find that I am usually lower than them!</span> As a small firm, I can
      keep my expenses way down to save my clients money!
   </p>
   </br>
   </br>
   </br>
   <h1 class="center" >One last bit of advice!</h1>
   <p>
      <span class="bold">Because we're small and I meet with each client individually, I can only take a limited
      number of new clients each year and I get a large response each year, so please contact me today as my appointment
      book fills up very quickly in the tax season!</span>
